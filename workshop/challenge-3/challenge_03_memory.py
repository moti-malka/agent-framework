"""
Challenge 03 — Scan Memory & Vulnerability Tracking
=====================================================
Before building scanner agents, you need a shared memory system that
tracks which files have been scanned and what vulnerabilities were found.

This memory will be shared across ALL scanner agents (Challenges 04–08).
The final workflow (Challenge 10) scores your results based on what
the memory contains — NOT the workflow's text output.

Your task:
  1. Build a ScanMemory ContextProvider that tracks files_covered and
     vulnerabilities found.
  2. Create @tool functions for agents to record their findings.

Export:
    scan_memory           — a ScanMemory ContextProvider instance
    report_vulnerability  — a @tool that records a vulnerability in memory
    mark_file_scanned     — a @tool that marks a file as analyzed

# TODO 1: Create a ScanMemory BaseContextProvider
#
# This BaseContextProvider tracks scan progress across multiple agents:
#   - files_covered (set of str): which files have been analyzed
#   - vulnerabilities (list of dict): findings so far, each dict has
#     keys "file" (str), "start_line" (int), "end_line" (int), "description" (str)
#
# Required attributes:
#   self.files_covered: set[str]
#   self.vulnerabilities: list[dict]
#
# Required methods:
#   reset()  — clears files_covered and vulnerabilities
#   _add_vuln(file, start_line, end_line, description, scanner="unknown") — adds a vulnerability to memory
#     but only if the same (file, start_line, end_line) combo isn't already recorded
#     For single-line vulnerabilities, start_line == end_line.
#     Each vulnerability dict should have keys: "file", "start_line", "end_line", "description", "scanner"
#
# BaseContextProvider hooks:
#
#   __init__(self, ...) — MUST call super().__init__(source_id="scan_memory")
#
#   async def before_run(self, *, agent, session: AgentSession, context: SessionContext, state: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
#     Called BEFORE an agent runs. Use context.extend_instructions(self.source_id, ...)
#     to tell the agent what files are already covered and how many
#     vulnerabilities were found so far, so agents can avoid duplicate work.
#
#   async def after_run(self, *, agent, session: AgentSession, context: SessionContext, state: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
#     Called AFTER an agent runs. Try to parse any structured vulnerability
#     JSON from the agent's response and add new findings to memory.
#     This is a backup for agents using response_format — they may
#     produce structured output without calling report_vulnerability.
#
# Assign the class to: ScanMemory
# Create a module-level instance: scan_memory = ScanMemory()
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

scan_memory = None  # Replace with your implementation


# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# TODO 2: Create a report_vulnerability tool
#
# A @tool-decorated function that records a single vulnerability in
# scan_memory. Scanner agents will call this for EACH finding.
#
# Parameters (use Annotated[type, Field(description=...)] ):
#   - file (str): relative file path where the vulnerability was found
#   - start_line (int): first line number of the vulnerability
#   - end_line (int): last line number (same as start_line for single-line issues)
#   - description (str): short description of the vulnerability
#   - scanner (str, optional): name of the scanner that found this (default="unknown")
#     Examples: "SecretsScanner", "CodeVulnScanner", "InfraScanner", "AuthCryptoScanner"
#
# The tool should:
#   - Call scan_memory._add_vuln(file, start_line, end_line, description, scanner)
#   - Also add the file to scan_memory.files_covered
#   - Return a confirmation string
#
# Assign to: report_vulnerability

# TODO 3: Create a mark_file_scanned tool
#
# A @tool-decorated function that marks a file as analyzed in memory.
# Agents should call this after reading a file, even if they found
# no vulnerabilities (so we track coverage).
#
# Parameters (use Annotated[type, Field(description=...)] ):
#   - file_path (str): relative file path that was analyzed
#
# Assign to: mark_file_scanned
