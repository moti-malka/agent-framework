Note: The checkpointing.png image is referenced in the notebook but doesn't exist yet.
This is a placeholder. The workflow will still run without it, but the visualization
will show a broken image link in the rendered notebook.

To fix: Create a diagram showing:
- Workflow execution timeline
- Checkpoint saves at superstep boundaries  
- Interruption/failure point
- Resume from checkpoint
- Completion

Recommended tools: draw.io, Excalidraw, or Graphviz
