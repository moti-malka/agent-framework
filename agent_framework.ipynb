Every section builds on the last, using an <strong>DropGo</strong> e-commerce support scenario as the running example.\n</p>\n\n---\n\n## What You'll Build\n\nStarting from a bare-bones chat agent, we incrementally add capabilities until we have a full multi-agent system with orchestration, memory, human oversight, and evaluation:\n\n| Section | What It Covers |\n|---------|----------------|\n| **1** | **Single Agent** \u2014 create an agent that reads an email and drafts a reply |\n| **2** | **Streaming** \u2014 stream tokens in real time for a live drafting UX |\n| **3** | **Sessions** \u2014 conversation history across multiple turns |\n| **4** | **Tools** \u2014 connect agents to internal APIs using `@tool` |\n| **5** | **Multimodal Input** \u2014 accept images and attachments alongside text |\n| **6** | **Structured Output** \u2014 return Pydantic models instead of free text |\n| **7** | **MCP Integration** \u2014 connect to external systems via hosted MCP servers |\n| **8** | **Human-in-the-Loop** \u2014 approval gates before risky actions execute |\n| **9** | **Middleware** \u2014 logging, timing, and observability hooks |\n| **10** | **Error Handling & Retry** \u2014 exponential backoff and circuit breaker patterns |\n| **11** | **Memory** \u2014 `BaseContextProvider` for cross-session knowledge that persists across conversations |\n| **12** | **Sequential Workflow** \u2014 agents execute in a fixed pipeline (classify \u2192 draft \u2192 review) | \u2014 agents execute in a fixed pipeline (classify \u2192 draft \u2192 review) |\n| **12.5** | **Branching Workflow** \u2014 conditional routing with Switch/Case patterns |\n| **13** | **Checkpointing** \u2014 fault-tolerant workflows with state persistence |\n| **14** | **Concurrent Workflow** \u2014 fan-out / fan-in with parallel agents and an aggregator |\n| **15** | **Group Chat** \u2014 round-robin and orchestrator-led multi-agent discussions |\n| **16** | **Magentic Orchestration** \u2014 dynamic planning with plan/review loops and HITL approval |\n| **17** | **Handoff** \u2014 peer-to-peer agent routing with autonomous mode and tool use |\n\nEach orchestration section includes a **PNG workflow visualization** generated with `WorkflowViz`.\n\n---\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- **Azure subscription** with Azure OpenAI access\n- **Graphviz** \u2014 required for workflow visualizations (`brew install graphviz` on macOS, `sudo apt install graphviz` on Linux or `winget install graphviz` on Windows)\n- **Azure OpenAI resource** with a deployed model (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`)\n- **Python 3.10+**\n- **Azure CLI** installed and authenticated (`az login`)"

    "# 11. Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Memory in Agent Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent framework provides **two levels of memory**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Session Memory** (Conversation-scoped)\n",
    "- `AgentSession` automatically maintains conversation history\n",
    "- Each turn (user message + agent response) is stored in the session\n",
    "- Memory lasts for the duration of the conversation\n",
    "- Perfect for: Context within a single conversation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Context Provider Memory** (Cross-conversation)\n",
    "- `BaseContextProvider` enables persistent memory across conversations\n",
    "- Tracks preferences, facts, and state that outlive a single session\n",
    "- Memory can be serialized and persisted to databases\n",
    "- Perfect for: User preferences, VIP status, long-term context\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Memory Works with BaseContextProvider\n",
    "\n",
    "The **BaseContextProvider** pattern has two key hooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "### `before_run(agent, session, context, state) -> None`\n",
    "Called **before** the agent processes a request.\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Inject additional context (instructions, preferences, facts) into the `SessionContext`\n",
    "- **Use case**: Add \"User prefers brief responses\" via `context.extend_instructions()`\n",
    "- **Returns**: Nothing (modifies `SessionContext` in place)\n",
    "\n",
    "### `after_run(agent, session, context, state) -> None`\n",
    "Called **after** the agent completes a response.\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Extract and store information from the conversation\n",
    "- **Use case**: Detect user said \"Call me Sarah\" and save name preference\n",
    "- **Returns**: Nothing (updates internal state)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use SessionContext?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `SessionContext` object is a **clean separation** between storage and execution:\n",
    "- **BaseContextProvider** manages memory (storage, persistence, state)\n",
    "- **SessionContext** carries instructions for a single request (ephemeral, request-scoped)\n",
    "- **Agent** receives context without knowing about the BaseContextProvider implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- \u2705 Decouple memory management from agent logic\n",
    "- \u2705 Multiple context providers can contribute different context (auth, preferences, history)\n",
    "- \u2705 Easy to test agents without complex state setup\n",
    "- \u2705 Memory can be swapped (in-memory \u2192 database) without changing agent code\n",
    "\n",
    "## How BaseContextProvider Enables Long-Term Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** BaseContextProvider itself is just the mechanism. For **true persistence across days**, you need:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Session Serialization**: `await session.serialize()` \u2192 save to database/file\n",
    "2. **Session Deserialization**: Load from database \u2192 `await agent.deserialize_session(data)`\n",
    "3. **Attach to agent**: Use the restored session in new conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-world flow:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Day 1 (Monday):\n",
    "- Customer: \"I'm David, keep it brief\"\n",
    "- Memory extracts: name=\"David\", tone=\"brief\"\n",
    "- Save to DB: {\"customer_id\": \"123\", \"name\": \"David\", \"tone\": \"brief\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "Day 5 (Friday):\n",
    "- Load from DB: {\"customer_id\": \"123\", \"name\": \"David\", \"tone\": \"brief\"}\n",
    "- Create BaseContextProvider with loaded data\n",
    "- Customer: \"What's your return policy?\"\n",
    "- Agent responds: \"Hey David! 30 days, easy returns.\" (brief, uses name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## DropGo Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "DropGo needs persistent preferences across conversations:\n",
    "- **Preferred language** (English, Hebrew, Spanish)\n",
    "- **Preferred tone** (formal, friendly, brief)\n",
    "- **Customer name**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The pattern:**\n",
    "1. **Extract** preferences using `after_run()` after each conversation\n",
    "2. **Serialize** session: `await session.serialize()` \u2192 dict\n",
    "3. **Save** to database with customer_id\n",
    "4. **Load** on next conversation: Query database by customer_id\n",
    "5. **Restore** session: `await agent.deserialize_session(data)`\n",
    "6. **Inject** preferences using `before_run()` before agent processes\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where BaseContextProvider becomes powerful:\n",
    "\u2705 Extract preferences automatically (via `after_run`)  \n",
    "\u2705 Save via session serialization  \n",
    "\u2705 Restore from database days/weeks later  \n",
    "\u2705 Inject them as context into future calls (via `before_run`)  \n",

    "## Production Caching Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Cache Invalidation Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# TTL-based (what we used)\n",
    "cache.set(key, response, ttl=1800)  # 30 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "# Event-driven invalidation\n",
    "def on_policy_update(policy_name):\n",
    "    cache.invalidate_by_prefix(f\"policy:{policy_name}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Manual invalidation for critical updates\n",
    "cache.clear_all()  # Nuclear option\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Distributed Caching (Redis)\n",
    "\n",
    "For multi-instance agent deployments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import redis.asyncio as redis\n",
    "\n",
    "class RedisCache:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, redis_url: str):\n",
    "        self.client = redis.from_url(redis_url)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    async def get(self, key: str) -> Optional[str]:\n",
    "        return await self.client.get(key)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    async def set(self, key: str, value: str, ttl: int = 3600):\n",
    "        await self.client.setex(key, ttl, value)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Semantic Caching (Advanced)\n",
    "\n",
    "Use embeddings to find semantically similar questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from agent_framework.azure import AzureOpenAIEmbeddingsClient\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generate embedding for cache lookup\n",
    "embedding = await embeddings_client.embed(email_text)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Find nearest neighbor in vector database\n",
    "similar_entry = vector_db.search(embedding, threshold=0.95)\n",
    "\n",
    "if similar_entry:\n",
    "    return similar_entry.cached_response\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Cache Monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "Track these metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hit Rate:** > 70% for FAQ scenarios\n",
    "- **Latency Reduction:** Cached responses should be <100ms\n",
    "- **Cost Savings:** Monitor LLM API call reduction\n",
    "- **Cache Size:** Watch for memory pressure\n",

    "\n",
    "\u2705 **Good Fit:**\n",
    "- FAQ scenarios (high query overlap)\n",
    "- Read-heavy workloads\n",
    "- Slow/expensive LLM calls\n",
    "- Surge events (Black Friday, product launches)\n",
    "\n",
    "\u274c **Bad Fit:**\n",
    "- Highly personalized responses\n",
    "- Real-time data requirements\n",
    "- Unique queries every time\n",
    "- Sensitive/PII data (privacy concerns)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Caching can reduce costs by 70-90%** for high-overlap query scenarios\n",
    "2. **Cache key normalization** is critical (typos shouldn't break cache)\n",
    "3. **TTL expiration** prevents stale data from being served\n",
    "4. **Distributed caching (Redis)** is essential for production multi-instance deployments\n",
    "5. **Monitor hit rates** to validate cache effectiveness\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next:** DropGo needs to handle complex workflows with long-running batch processes. What happens if a server crashes mid-batch? We'll explore **checkpointing and state persistence** to enable workflow resumption.\n"

    "# Clean multi-way branching\n",

    "### 2. Use Confidence Thresholds\n",
    "\n",
    "Low-confidence classifications should route to human review:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def is_tech_support(classification: EmailClassification) -> bool:\n",
    "    return (\n",

    "\n",
    "Track these metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "routing_metrics = {\n",
    "    'total_emails': 1000,\n",

    "\n",
    "Different instructions can dramatically affect routing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Variant A: Conservative (more escalations)\n",
    "\"When in doubt, escalate to human review.\"\n",
    "\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced Routing Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-Selection (Parallel Routing)\n",
    "\n",
    "Send one email to **multiple** handlers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Email needs both refund AND tech support\n",
    ".add_multi_selection_edge(\n",

    "    ]\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic Routing (Runtime Configuration)\n",
    "\n",
    "Route based on external factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def route_by_time_of_day(classification: EmailClassification) -> str:\n",
    "    current_hour = datetime.now().hour\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if 9 <= current_hour <= 17:  # Business hours\n",
    "        return \"human_agent\"  # Route to live agents\n",
    "    else:  # After hours\n",

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Branching workflows enable context-aware routing** \u2014 not all emails need the same treatment\n",
    "2. **Switch/Case patterns scale better** than multiple conditional edges\n",
    "3. **Always define a Default case** to prevent messages from getting stuck\n",

    "## Checkpointing Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Checkpoint Granularity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Too Frequent:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# \u274c Checkpoint after every message (overhead!)\n",
    "await checkpoint_manager.save(state)  # Called 100 times/second\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Too Infrequent:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# \u274c Checkpoint only at end (defeats the purpose!)\n",
    "# Process 10,000 emails \u2192 1 checkpoint\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Just Right:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# \u2705 Checkpoint after each logical unit of work\n",
    "for email in batch:\n",
    "    await process_email(email)\n",
    "    await checkpoint_manager.save(state)  # 1 checkpoint per email\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Idempotency\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure operations can be safely retried:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# \u274c BAD: Non-idempotent (sends duplicate emails)\n",
    "await send_email(draft)\n",
    "await checkpoint_manager.save(state)\n",
    "\n",
    "# \u2705 GOOD: Idempotent with deduplication\n",
    "email_id = f\"{order_id}_{timestamp}\"\n",
    "if not await email_already_sent(email_id):\n",
    "    await send_email(draft, email_id=email_id)\n",
    "await checkpoint_manager.save(state)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Checkpoint Retention Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Keep last N checkpoints\n",
    "checkpoint_manager.set_retention(max_checkpoints=100)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Or time-based retention\n",
    "checkpoint_manager.set_retention(max_age_hours=24)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Or manual cleanup\n",
    "old_checkpoints = checkpoint_manager.list_checkpoints(\n",
    "    older_than=datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7)\n",
    ")\n",
    "for checkpoint_id in old_checkpoints:\n",
    "    checkpoint_manager.delete(checkpoint_id)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Production Storage Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Azure Blob Storage\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from agent_framework.azure import AzureBlobCheckpointStorage\n",
    "\n",
    "storage = AzureBlobCheckpointStorage(\n",
    "    connection_string=os.environ[\"AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING\"],\n",
    "    container_name=\"workflow-checkpoints\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cosmos DB (for global distribution)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from agent_framework.azure import CosmosDBCheckpointStorage\n",
    "\n",
    "storage = CosmosDBCheckpointStorage(\n",
    "    endpoint=os.environ[\"COSMOS_ENDPOINT\"],\n",
    "    key=os.environ[\"COSMOS_KEY\"],\n",
    "    database=\"agent_workflows\",\n",
    "    container=\"checkpoints\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced Checkpoint Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Time-Travel Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "Replay workflow from any historical checkpoint:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Find checkpoint from 2 hours ago\n",
    "checkpoint_id = checkpoint_manager.find_checkpoint_at_time(\n",
    "    datetime.now() - timedelta(hours=2)\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load and replay\n",
    "workflow = await checkpoint_manager.load_workflow(checkpoint_id)\n",
    "await workflow.run(...)  # Replay from that point\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Parallel Workflow Checkpointing\n",
    "\n",
    "Each branch checkpoints independently:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "workflow = (\n",
    "    ConcurrentBuilder()\n",
    "    .participants([agent1, agent2, agent3])\n",
    "    .with_checkpointing(\n",
    "        checkpoint_manager,\n",
    "        granularity=\"per_agent\"  # Checkpoint after each agent completes\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    .build()\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Conditional Checkpointing\n",
    "\n",
    "Only checkpoint on certain conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def should_checkpoint(state: dict) -> bool:\n",
    "    # Only checkpoint after expensive operations\n",
    "    return state.get(\"cost_usd\", 0) > 1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "workflow = (\n",
    "    SequentialBuilder()\n",
    "    .register_participants([agent1, agent2])\n",
    "    .with_checkpointing(\n",
    "        checkpoint_manager,\n",
    "        condition=should_checkpoint\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    .build()\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Checkpointing enables fault-tolerant workflows** that survive crashes and restarts\n",
    "2. **Checkpoint after logical units of work** (not too frequent, not too infrequent)\n",
    "3. **Ensure operations are idempotent** to safely replay from checkpoints\n",
    "4. **Use durable storage (Azure Blob, Cosmos DB)** for production workloads\n",
    "5. **Implement retention policies** to manage checkpoint storage costs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Production Impact:**\n",
    "- \u2705 0% duplicate work after crashes\n",
    "- \u2705 100% workflow resumption success rate\n",
    "- \u2705 $0 wasted API costs on retries\n",
    "- \u2705 Time-travel debugging for incident analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next:** Now that DropGo can handle sequential workflows with checkpointing, let's explore **concurrent workflows** where multiple agents work in parallel to reduce latency.\n"

    "# 14. Concurrent Workflow\n\n![Concurrent Workflow](images/concurrent-workflow.png)\n\nDropGo processes hundreds of emails per hour. Some tasks are **independent** \u2014 they don't need each other's output. Running them one after another wastes time.\n\n**`ConcurrentBuilder`** distributes the **same input** to multiple agents simultaneously. Each agent works independently and in parallel. Results are collected once all agents finish.\n\n---\n\n### What is Fan-Out / Fan-In?\n\nYou'll hear the terms **fan-out** and **fan-in** in workflow literature. They describe exactly what `ConcurrentBuilder` does:\n\n| Term | What it means | ConcurrentBuilder equivalent |\n|------|--------------|------------------------------|\n| **Fan-Out** | Broadcast one input to N workers | `.participants([agent1, agent2, agent3])` \u2014 all receive the same prompt |\n| **Fan-In** | Collect all N results back into one | Default aggregation or `.with_aggregator(callback)` |\n\n> **Think of it like email CC** \u2014 you send the same message to three people. Each replies independently. You read all replies and decide what to do. That's fan-out / fan-in.\n\n`ConcurrentBuilder` handles both automatically. You don't need to manage fan-out/fan-in yourself \u2014 it's built in. The `.with_aggregator()` option lets you customize **how** results are combined (the fan-in step).\n\n---\n\n### When to Use Concurrent vs. Sequential\n\n| Question | Sequential | Concurrent |\n|----------|-----------|------------|\n| Do agents depend on each other's output? | \u2705 Yes \u2014 use sequential | \u274c No \u2014 use concurrent |\n| Does order matter? | \u2705 Yes \u2014 A must finish before B | \u274c No \u2014 all can run at once |\n| Example | classify \u2192 draft \u2192 review | respond + summarize + tag |\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n| Concept | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **`ConcurrentBuilder`** | Creates a parallel workflow \u2014 all agents run simultaneously |\n| **`.participants([...])`** | List of agents that each receive the same input |\n| **`.with_aggregator(fn)`** | Optional custom function to synthesize results |\n| **`WorkflowOutputEvent`** | Final output containing aggregated messages from all agents |"

    "# 15. Group Chat\n\n![Group Chat Pattern](images/group-chat.png)\n\nSequential runs agents in a fixed pipeline. Concurrent runs them independently. But what if agents need to **collaborate** \u2014 reviewing each other's work, building on each other's ideas, and iterating?\n\n**`GroupChatBuilder`** creates an orchestrated conversation where agents take turns speaking while sharing the **full conversation history**. An orchestrator (either a simple function or an AI agent) decides who speaks next.\n\n---\n\n### How It Works\n\n```\n                    \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n                    \u2502 Orchestrator \u2502  \u2190 Decides who speaks next\n                    \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n                           \u2502\n            \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u253c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n            \u25bc              \u25bc              \u25bc\n     \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510 \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510 \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n     \u2502  Agent A   \u2502 \u2502  Agent B   \u2502 \u2502  Agent C   \u2502\n     \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518 \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518 \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n            \u2502              \u2502              \u2502\n            \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u253c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n                           \u25bc\n                   Shared Conversation\n```\n\nEach agent sees **everything** said so far \u2014 including other agents' responses. This enables iterative refinement where later agents can address issues raised by earlier ones.\n\n---\n\n### DropGo Use Case: Review Committee\n\nBefore sending any response, DropGo enterprise drafts must pass through:\n1. **Security review** \u2014 PII exposure, compliance violations\n2. **Accuracy review** \u2014 unrealistic promises, unverified claims\n3. **Final editor** \u2014 applies all feedback and produces the send-ready email\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n| Concept | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **`GroupChatBuilder`** | Creates a group chat workflow with orchestrated speaker selection |\n| **`.with_orchestrator()`** | Configure speaker selection: `selection_func=` for simple logic, `agent=` for AI-driven |\n| **`.with_termination_condition()`** | Stop the conversation when a condition is met (e.g., N turns completed) |\n| **`GroupChatState`** | Passed to selector \u2014 has `.current_round`, `.participants`, `.conversation` |\n| **Shared Context** | Every agent sees the full conversation history including other agents' messages |"

    "# 16. Magentic Orchestration\n\n![Magentic Pattern](images/magentic-workflow.png)\n\nDropGo has reliable pipelines (sequential), fast parallel analysis (concurrent), and a review committee (group chat). But now stakeholders want something harder:\n\n> *\"Research last week's complaint patterns, analyze root causes, and produce an executive intelligence report.\"*\n\nNobody knows the steps upfront. Maybe the researcher finds a spike in shipping complaints, so the analyst needs to drill into that region. Maybe the analysis reveals a billing anomaly that needs more research. **The workflow path emerges as the task unfolds.**\n\nThis is where **Magentic orchestration** shines \u2014 a **manager agent** creates a plan, dynamically delegates to specialists, tracks progress, and iterates until the task is truly complete.\n\n---\n\n### Magentic vs. Group Chat \u2014 When to Use Each\n\nBoth patterns involve a set of agents coordinated by an orchestrator, but they solve fundamentally different problems:\n\n| | **Group Chat** | **Magentic** |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Best for** | Iterative refinement of a *single artifact* | Open-ended tasks requiring *research + synthesis* |\n| **Flow** | Conversation \u2014 agents respond to each other | Plan \u2192 Delegate \u2192 Execute \u2192 Assess \u2192 Iterate |\n| **Planning** | None \u2014 orchestrator just picks the next speaker | Manager creates and updates a structured plan |\n| **Progress tracking** | No built-in tracking | Progress ledger with stall/reset detection |\n| **Shared context** | Full conversation history | Manager maintains task context and delegates subtasks |\n| **Example** | Review committee editing a draft email | \"Investigate complaint trends and write a report\" |\n| **Termination** | Condition on messages (e.g., everyone spoke twice) | Manager decides task is complete, or round limits hit |\n\n**Rule of thumb:** If your agents are *talking to each other* about one thing \u2192 **Group Chat**. If a manager is *assigning work* across a multi-step investigation \u2192 **Magentic**.\n\n---\n\n### How It Works\n\n```\n                    \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n                    \u2502  Manager Agent   \u2502  \u2190 Creates plan, tracks progress\n                    \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n                             \u2502\n               \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 Plan \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n               \u2502    & Delegate      \u2502\n               \u25bc                    \u25bc\n        \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510     \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n        \u2502  Research    \u2502     \u2502  Analysis   \u2502\n        \u2502  Agent      \u2502     \u2502  Agent      \u2502\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518     \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n               \u2502                   \u2502\n               \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 Results \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n                        \u2502\n                        \u25bc\n               \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n               \u2502 Manager assesses \u2502\n               \u2502 progress & loops \u2502\n               \u2502 or synthesizes   \u2502\n               \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n```\n\n### Execution Flow\n\n1. **Planning Phase** \u2014 Manager analyzes the task and creates a structured plan\n2. **Agent Selection** \u2014 Manager picks the best agent for the current subtask\n3. **Execution** \u2014 Selected agent does its work\n4. **Progress Assessment** \u2014 Manager evaluates via a progress ledger\n5. **Stall Detection** \u2014 If no progress, auto-replan (up to `max_stall_count`)\n6. **Iteration** \u2014 Steps 2-5 repeat until complete or `max_round_count` hit\n7. **Final Synthesis** \u2014 Manager combines everything into a final result\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n| Concept | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **`MagenticBuilder`** | Creates a Magentic workflow with a planning manager |\n| **`.with_manager(agent=)`** | Set the manager agent and tuning knobs |\n| **`max_round_count`** | Maximum delegation rounds before forced completion |\n| **`max_stall_count`** | How many stalls before the manager replans |\n| **`MagenticOrchestratorEvent`** | Emitted when the manager makes planning decisions |\n| **`MagenticProgressLedger`** | Structured progress tracking \u2014 who's next, why, what's done |\n| **`.with_plan_review()`** | Enable human-in-the-loop plan approval before execution |"

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS  \n",
      "   - The request is for an executive briefing for the board meeting tomorrow.  \n",
      "   - The briefing needs to cover complaint categories, business impact, root causes, financial exposure, competitor best practices, and include a set of recommendations and an action plan.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. FACTS TO LOOK UP  \n",
      "   - The top complaint categories from the past week, including their volumes.  \n",
      "   - The single complaint category with the highest business impact based on volume, revenue risk, and customer churn potential.  \n",
      "   - Specific root causes related to operational issues for the highest-impact complaint category.  \n",
      "   - Estimated weekly revenue at risk, projected churn rate, and cost of inaction over 30 days.  \n",
      "   - Competitor best practices for handling the identified complaint category.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. FACTS TO DERIVE  \n",
      "   - The significance of each complaint category in terms of revenue risk and customer churn potential may need to be calculated.  \n",
      "   - The financial exposure, including revenue at risk and cost of inaction over the next 30 days, will require computations based on available data.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. EDUCATED GUESSES  \n",
      "   - It is likely that the top complaint categories may include issues related to delivery, customer service, product quality, or app functionality based on common industry trends.  \n",
      "   - The category with the highest business impact will potentially be one that has a direct link to customer churn, often delivery or service-related issues.  \n",
      "   - The root causes might involve factors such as supplier delays, inefficiencies in process management, or insufficient staffing, given the operations of a delivery service.  \n",
      "   - The financial impact of inaction could be severe if a significant number of customers are at risk of churning in response to these complaints.\n",

      "\n",
      "# Executive Briefing: Addressing Shipping Delays at DropGo\n",
      "\n",
      "## Problem Summary:\n",
      "Over the past week, DropGo has seen a surge in customer complaints, primarily related to shipping delays, which accounted for 150 complaints, representing 30% of total issues. This situation is negatively impacting customer satisfaction and loyalty, exposing us to potential revenue loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Financial Impact:\n",
      "- **Weekly Revenue at Risk**: $15,000 due to complaints related to shipping delays.\n",
      "- **Projected Revenue Loss from Churn**: An anticipated loss of $60,000 over the next 30 days, given that approximately 30 customers exposed to shipping issues may decide to churn.\n",
      "- **Total Cost of Inaction Over 30 Days**: **$120,000** (this sum includes both weekly revenue at risk and long-term losses due to churn).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Root Cause Analysis:\n",
      "The analysis of complaints revealed several core operational issues contributing to the shipping delays:\n",
      "1. **Carrier Delays (45%)**: Unforeseen disruptions from shipping partners.\n",
      "2. **Inventory Issues (25%)**: High-demand items being out of stock led to delays.\n",
      "3. **Order Processing Delays (15%)**: Inefficiencies in order fulfillment processes.\n",
      "4. **Address Verification Problems (10%)**: Incorrect or incomplete customer addresses.\n",
      "5. **Bad Weather Conditions (5%)**: Natural weather disruptions affecting certain routes.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Prioritized Recommendations:\n",
      "1. **Optimize Carrier Performance**\n",
      "   - **Action**: Review existing contracts and performance metrics with shipping carriers and consider alternatives.\n",
      "   - **Estimated ROI**: Preventing estimated churn-related losses of $60,000 and capturing $15,000 in weekly sales due to timely deliveries.\n",
      "   - **Timeframe**: Immediate 1-2 weeks for assessment.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Enhance Inventory Management**\n",
      "   - **Action**: Implement a demand forecasting tool to mitigate stock shortages of popular items.\n",
      "   - **Estimated ROI**: Reduction in out-of-stock scenarios could recover ~$45,000 in at-risk revenue monthly.\n",
      "   - **Timeframe**: 3-4 weeks for implementation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Improve Customer Communication and Service**\n",
      "   - **Action**: Establish automated notifications for shipping updates and introduce AI-driven customer support.\n",
      "   - **Estimated ROI**: Enhanced customer communication could reduce churn by 10%, recapturing ~$30,000 in at-risk revenue.\n",
      "   - **Timeframe**: 4-5 weeks for setup.\n",

    "# 17. Handoff Orchestration\n\n![Handoff Orchestration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/user-guide/workflows/resources/images/orchestration-handoff.png)\n\n## How It Works\n\nIn a **Handoff** orchestration, agents transfer control to one another based on context \u2014 there is **no central orchestrator**. Each agent can decide when to hand the conversation off to another specialist, creating dynamic, peer-to-peer routing. This is fundamentally different from the other orchestrations we've built so far:\n\n| Aspect | Handoff | Sequential / Group Chat |\n|--------|---------|------------------------|\n| **Control Flow** | Agents pass control to each other directly | Orchestrator / fixed order manages flow |\n| **Task Ownership** | Receiving agent takes **full ownership** | Orchestrator retains responsibility |\n| **Context** | Full conversation history shared across all agents | Varies by orchestration type |\n| **Topology** | Mesh \u2014 agents form a peer network | Star / chain \u2014 central coordinator |\n\n## Core API\n\n| Method | Purpose |\n|--------|---------|\n| `HandoffBuilder(name, participants)` | Create a handoff workflow with specialist agents |\n| `.with_start_agent(agent)` | Set which agent receives user input first |\n| `.add_handoff(source, [targets])` | Define custom routing rules (who can hand off to whom) |\n| `.with_termination_condition(fn)` | Custom logic to decide when the workflow completes |\n| `.with_autonomous_mode()` | Agents continue without waiting for human input |\n| `HandoffAgentUserRequest.create_response(text)` | Send user reply when an agent pauses for input |\n| `HandoffAgentUserRequest.terminate()` | End the workflow early from the user side |\n\n## DropGo Use Case: Multi-Department Email Escalation\n\nReal support inboxes don't have a single agent that handles everything. Instead, emails flow through **multiple departments** depending on the issue:\n\n```\nCustomer Email\n    \u2193\n\u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n\u2502  Triage     \u2502  \u2190 Reads the email, classifies the issue\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n       \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2192 Billing Agent      (payment disputes, invoices, subscription changes)\n       \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2192 Account Agent      (password resets, access, account closures)\n       \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2192 Compliance Agent   (data requests, GDPR, legal escalations)\n```\n\nEach specialist has **domain-specific tools** and can **escalate to other departments** when the issue crosses boundaries \u2014 e.g. a billing dispute that reveals a security breach gets escalated from Billing \u2192 Accounts \u2192 Compliance. The triage agent never touches the issue itself; it only routes.\n\nThis is exactly what **handoff** is designed for \u2014 no central brain re-reads every message; agents hand off ownership entirely."
