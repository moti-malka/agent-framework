    "# 11. Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Memory in Agent Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent framework provides **two levels of memory**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Thread Memory** (Conversation-scoped)\n",
    "- `AgentThread` automatically maintains conversation history\n",
    "- Each turn (user message + agent response) is stored in the thread\n",
    "- Memory lasts for the duration of the conversation\n",
    "- Perfect for: Context within a single conversation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Context Provider Memory** (Cross-conversation)\n",
    "- `ContextProvider` enables persistent memory across conversations\n",
    "- Tracks preferences, facts, and state that outlive a single thread\n",
    "- Memory can be serialized and persisted to databases\n",
    "- Perfect for: User preferences, VIP status, long-term context\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Memory Works with ContextProvider\n",
    "\n",
    "The **ContextProvider** pattern has two key hooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "### `invoking(messages, **kwargs) -> Context`\n",
    "Called **before** the agent processes a request.\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Inject additional context (instructions, preferences, facts) into the agent\n",
    "- **Use case**: Add \"User prefers brief responses\" to agent instructions\n",
    "- **Returns**: `Context` object with additional instructions or data\n",
    "\n",
    "### `invoked(request_messages, response_messages, **kwargs) -> None`\n",
    "Called **after** the agent completes a response.\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Extract and store information from the conversation\n",
    "- **Use case**: Detect user said \"Call me Sarah\" and save name preference\n",
    "- **Returns**: Nothing (updates internal state)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Context?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Context` object is a **clean separation** between storage and execution:\n",
    "- **ContextProvider** manages memory (storage, persistence, state)\n",
    "- **Context** carries instructions for a single request (ephemeral, request-scoped)\n",
    "- **Agent** receives Context without knowing about the ContextProvider implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- ✅ Decouple memory management from agent logic\n",
    "- ✅ Multiple ContextProviders can contribute different Context (auth, preferences, history)\n",
    "- ✅ Easy to test agents without complex state setup\n",
    "- ✅ Memory can be swapped (in-memory → database) without changing agent code\n",
    "\n",
    "## How ContextProvider Enables Long-Term Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** ContextProvider itself is just the mechanism. For **true persistence across days**, you need:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Serialization**: `ContextProvider.serialize()` → save to database/file\n",
    "2. **Deserialization**: Load from database → create ContextProvider with saved data\n",
    "3. **Attach to agent**: Use the restored ContextProvider in new conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-world flow:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Day 1 (Monday):\n",
    "- Customer: \"I'm David, keep it brief\"\n",
    "- Memory extracts: name=\"David\", tone=\"brief\"\n",
    "- Save to DB: {\"customer_id\": \"123\", \"name\": \"David\", \"tone\": \"brief\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "Day 5 (Friday):\n",
    "- Load from DB: {\"customer_id\": \"123\", \"name\": \"David\", \"tone\": \"brief\"}\n",
    "- Create ContextProvider with loaded data\n",
    "- Customer: \"What's your return policy?\"\n",
    "- Agent responds: \"Hey David! 30 days, easy returns.\" (brief, uses name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## InboxOps Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "InboxOps needs persistent preferences across conversations:\n",
    "- **Preferred language** (English, Hebrew, Spanish)\n",
    "- **Preferred tone** (formal, friendly, brief)\n",
    "- **Customer name**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The pattern:**\n",
    "1. **Extract** preferences using `invoked()` after each conversation\n",
    "2. **Serialize** memory: `memory.serialize()` → JSON string\n",
    "3. **Save** to database with customer_id\n",
    "4. **Load** on next conversation: Query database by customer_id\n",
    "5. **Restore** memory: `SupportMemory(chat_client, **json.loads(saved_data))`\n",
    "6. **Inject** preferences using `invoking()` before agent processes\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where ContextProvider becomes powerful:\n",
    "✅ Extract preferences automatically (via `invoked`)  \n",
    "✅ Save to database using `serialize()`  \n",
    "✅ Restore from database days/weeks later  \n",
    "✅ Inject them as context into future calls (via `invoking`)  \n",
    "✅ Maintain consistent customer experience across sessions\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "In a **Handoff** orchestration, agents transfer control to one another based on context — there is **no central orchestrator**. Each agent can decide when to hand the conversation off to another specialist, creating dynamic, peer-to-peer routing. This is fundamentally different from the other orchestrations we've built so far:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Handoff | Sequential / Group Chat |\n",
    "|--------|---------|------------------------|\n",
    "| **Control Flow** | Agents pass control to each other directly | Orchestrator / fixed order manages flow |\n",
    "| **Task Ownership** | Receiving agent takes **full ownership** | Orchestrator retains responsibility |\n",
    "| **Context** | Full conversation history shared across all agents | Varies by orchestration type |\n",
    "| **Topology** | Mesh — agents form a peer network | Star / chain — central coordinator |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core API\n",
    "\n",
    "| Method | Purpose |\n",
    "|--------|---------|\n",
    "| `HandoffBuilder(name, participants)` | Create a handoff workflow with specialist agents |\n",
    "| `.with_start_agent(agent)` | Set which agent receives user input first |\n",
    "| `.add_handoff(source, [targets])` | Define custom routing rules (who can hand off to whom) |\n",
    "| `.with_termination_condition(fn)` | Custom logic to decide when the workflow completes |\n",
    "| `.with_autonomous_mode()` | Agents continue without waiting for human input |\n",
    "| `HandoffAgentUserRequest.create_response(text)` | Send user reply when an agent pauses for input |\n",
    "| `HandoffAgentUserRequest.terminate()` | End the workflow early from the user side |\n",
    "\n",
    "## InboxOps Use Case: Multi-Department Email Escalation\n",
    "\n",
    "Real support inboxes don't have a single agent that handles everything. Instead, emails flow through **multiple departments** depending on the issue:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Customer Email\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "┌─────────────┐\n",
    "│  Triage     │  ← Reads the email, classifies the issue\n",
    "└──────┬──────┘\n",
    "       ├──→ Billing Agent      (payment disputes, invoices, subscription changes)\n",
    "       ├──→ Account Agent      (password resets, access, account closures)\n",
    "       └──→ Compliance Agent   (data requests, GDPR, legal escalations)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each specialist has **domain-specific tools** and can **escalate to other departments** when the issue crosses boundaries — e.g. a billing dispute that reveals a security breach gets escalated from Billing → Accounts → Compliance. The triage agent never touches the issue itself; it only routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly what **handoff** is designed for — no central brain re-reads every message; agents hand off ownership entirely."
