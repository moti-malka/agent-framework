    "- ✅ **Classifies** incoming emails (Spam / Not Spam / Uncertain)\n",

    "- ✅ **Requires approval** before sending sensitive replies\n",
    "- ✅ **Remembers** user preferences (language, tone, name)\n",
    "- ✅ **Processes in parallel** for long emails (response + summary)\n",
    "- ✅ **Uses multiple reviewers** for quality control (security, tone, accuracy)\n",
    "- ✅ **Logs** every operation for observability\n",
