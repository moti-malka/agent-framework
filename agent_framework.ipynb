    "\n",
    "We've implemented **4 critical resilience patterns**:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Pattern | Implementation | InboxOps Benefit |\n",
    "|---------|----------------|------------------|\n",
    "| **Retry + Backoff** | `retry_with_exponential_backoff()` | Handles transient API failures gracefully |\n",
    "| **Timeout Handling** | `asyncio.wait_for(timeout=30s)` | Prevents hanging requests, maintains SLA |\n",
    "| **Circuit Breaker** | `CircuitBreaker` class | Stops calling failing services, prevents cascades |\n",
    "| **Graceful Degradation** | `agent_call_with_fallback()` | Always responds, even with reduced functionality |\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Each Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# 1. Single transient failure \u2192 Retry\n",
    "result = await async_retry_with_backoff(agent.run, max_retries=3)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Prevent hanging \u2192 Timeout\n",
    "result = await asyncio.wait_for(agent.run(msg), timeout=30.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Service repeatedly failing \u2192 Circuit Breaker\n",
    "result = circuit_breaker.call(external_api_call)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Critical path must always work \u2192 Graceful Degradation\n",
    "result = await agent_call_with_fallback(msg)  # Falls back to basic agent\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Combine patterns**: Use retry + timeout + circuit breaker together\n",
    "2. **Monitor error rates**: Track retry counts, circuit breaker trips\n",
    "3. **Set appropriate timeouts**: InboxOps uses 30s for customer SLA\n",
    "4. **Log everything**: Include context (order_id, customer_id) in errors\n",
    "5. **Test failure scenarios**: Simulate API failures, timeouts in staging\n",
