      "\n",
      "5. **Update Your Browser**:\n",
      "   - Ensure your browser is up-to-date, as outdated versions can lead to compatibility issues with payment processing.\n",

      "6. **Disable Browser Extensions**:\n",
      "   - Turn off any ad blockers or browser extensions that may interfere with the checkout process.\n",

    "# 11. Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Memory in Agent Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent framework provides **two levels of memory**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Thread Memory** (Conversation-scoped)\n",
    "- `AgentThread` automatically maintains conversation history\n",
    "- Each turn (user message + agent response) is stored in the thread\n",
    "- Memory lasts for the duration of the conversation\n",
    "- Perfect for: Context within a single conversation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Context Provider Memory** (Cross-conversation)\n",
    "- `ContextProvider` enables persistent memory across conversations\n",
    "- Tracks preferences, facts, and state that outlive a single thread\n",
    "- Memory can be serialized and persisted to databases\n",
    "- Perfect for: User preferences, VIP status, long-term context\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Memory Works with ContextProvider\n",
    "\n",
    "The **ContextProvider** pattern has two key hooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "### `invoking(messages, **kwargs) -> Context`\n",
    "Called **before** the agent processes a request.\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Inject additional context (instructions, preferences, facts) into the agent\n",
    "- **Use case**: Add \"User prefers brief responses\" to agent instructions\n",
    "- **Returns**: `Context` object with additional instructions or data\n",
    "\n",
    "### `invoked(request_messages, response_messages, **kwargs) -> None`\n",
    "Called **after** the agent completes a response.\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Extract and store information from the conversation\n",
    "- **Use case**: Detect user said \"Call me Sarah\" and save name preference\n",
    "- **Returns**: Nothing (updates internal state)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Context?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Context` object is a **clean separation** between storage and execution:\n",
    "- **ContextProvider** manages memory (storage, persistence, state)\n",
    "- **Context** carries instructions for a single request (ephemeral, request-scoped)\n",
    "- **Agent** receives Context without knowing about the ContextProvider implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- \u2705 Decouple memory management from agent logic\n",
    "- \u2705 Multiple ContextProviders can contribute different Context (auth, preferences, history)\n",
    "- \u2705 Easy to test agents without complex state setup\n",
    "- \u2705 Memory can be swapped (in-memory \u2192 database) without changing agent code\n",
    "\n",
    "## How ContextProvider Enables Long-Term Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** ContextProvider itself is just the mechanism. For **true persistence across days**, you need:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Serialization**: `ContextProvider.serialize()` \u2192 save to database/file\n",
    "2. **Deserialization**: Load from database \u2192 create ContextProvider with saved data\n",
    "3. **Attach to agent**: Use the restored ContextProvider in new conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-world flow:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Day 1 (Monday):\n",
    "- Customer: \"I'm David, keep it brief\"\n",
    "- Memory extracts: name=\"David\", tone=\"brief\"\n",
    "- Save to DB: {\"customer_id\": \"123\", \"name\": \"David\", \"tone\": \"brief\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "Day 5 (Friday):\n",
    "- Load from DB: {\"customer_id\": \"123\", \"name\": \"David\", \"tone\": \"brief\"}\n",
    "- Create ContextProvider with loaded data\n",
    "- Customer: \"What's your return policy?\"\n",
    "- Agent responds: \"Hey David! 30 days, easy returns.\" (brief, uses name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## InboxOps Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "InboxOps needs persistent preferences across conversations:\n",
    "- **Preferred language** (English, Hebrew, Spanish)\n",
    "- **Preferred tone** (formal, friendly, brief)\n",
    "- **Customer name**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The pattern:**\n",
    "1. **Extract** preferences using `invoked()` after each conversation\n",
    "2. **Serialize** memory: `memory.serialize()` \u2192 JSON string\n",
    "3. **Save** to database with customer_id\n",
    "4. **Load** on next conversation: Query database by customer_id\n",
    "5. **Restore** memory: `SupportMemory(chat_client, **json.loads(saved_data))`\n",
    "6. **Inject** preferences using `invoking()` before agent processes\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where ContextProvider becomes powerful:\n",
    "\u2705 Extract preferences automatically (via `invoked`)  \n",
    "\u2705 Save to database using `serialize()`  \n",
    "\u2705 Restore from database days/weeks later  \n",
    "\u2705 Inject them as context into future calls (via `invoking`)  \n",
    "\u2705 Maintain consistent customer experience across sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement a `SupportMemory` ContextProvider with serialization support."

    "> *\"Research last week's complaint patterns, analyze root causes, and produce an executive intelligence report.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "Nobody knows the steps upfront. Maybe the researcher finds a spike in shipping complaints, so the analyst needs to drill into that region. Maybe the analysis reveals a billing anomaly that needs more research. **The workflow path emerges as the task unfolds.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where **Magentic orchestration** shines \u2014 a **manager agent** creates a plan, dynamically delegates to specialists, tracks progress, and iterates until the task is truly complete.\n",

    "### Magentic vs. Group Chat \u2014 When to Use Each\n",

    "| **Progress tracking** | No built-in tracking | Progress ledger with stall/reset detection |\n",
    "| **Shared context** | Full conversation history | Manager maintains task context and delegates subtasks |\n",
    "| **Example** | Review committee editing a draft email | \"Investigate complaint trends and write a report\" |\n",
    "| **Termination** | Condition on messages (e.g., everyone spoke twice) | Manager decides task is complete, or round limits hit |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule of thumb:** If your agents are *talking to each other* about one thing \u2192 **Group Chat**. If a manager is *assigning work* across a multi-step investigation \u2192 **Magentic**.\n",

    "The basic task above is fairly straightforward. But Magentic really shines when the **solution path isn't known upfront** and the manager needs to send agents back multiple times as new information emerges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we give the manager a deliberately complex, multi-phase task:\n",
    "1. First, **research** complaint patterns broadly\n",
    "2. Then **analyze** to find the worst category\n",
    "3. But the analysis reveals a need for **more research** into root causes\n",
    "4. The analyst then needs the new data to **calculate financial impact**\n",
    "5. Only then can the manager produce the final report\n",
    "\n",
    "This back-and-forth delegation is exactly what separates Magentic from simpler patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also enable **`.with_plan_review()`** \u2014 the manager proposes a plan, and your code can **approve** or **revise** it before execution begins. For group-chat-based orchestrations (Group Chat and Magentic), the orchestrator can also request human feedback and approvals as needed.\n",

      "#### Step 1: Volume of Complaints\n",

      "\n",
      "- **Shipping Delays**: 120 complaints\n",
      "- **Refund Requests**: 85 complaints\n",

      "- **Billing Disputes**: 45 complaints\n",
      "- **Account Access Issues**: 30 complaints\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 2: Revenue Risk Assessment\n",
      "Assuming an average order value (AOV) of $50, we can estimate potential revenue implications for Refund Requests and Shipping Delays:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Shipping Delays**: \n",

      "   - Revenue Impact = 120 complaints * 10% cancellation rate * $50 AOV = $600\n",

      "2. **Refund Requests**: \n",
      "   - If 100% of these complaints result in returns.\n",
      "   - Revenue Impact = 85 complaints * $50 AOV = $4,250\n",

      "3. **Product Defects**: \n",

      "   - Revenue Impact = 60 complaints * 20% return rate * $50 AOV = $600\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Billing Disputes**: \n",
      "   - A 5% cancellation from billing issues.\n",
      "   - Revenue Impact = 45 complaints * 5% cancellation rate * $50 AOV = $112.50\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Account Access Issues**: \n",
      "   - Assuming a minor impact here, 2% churn due to access issues.\n",
      "   - Revenue Impact = 30 complaints * 2% churn rate * $50 AOV = $30\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 3: Customer Churn Potential\n",
      "- **Shipping Delays**: High potential churn due to customer frustration with fulfillment process.\n",
      "- **Refund Requests**: High risk since customers dissatisfied with their purchases might not return.\n",
      "- **Product Defects**: Moderate risk; customers could switch brands due to quality issues.\n",
      "- **Billing Disputes**: Moderate impact; affected customers might leave due to perceived financial errors.\n",
      "- **Account Access Issues**: Lower impact, but still can frustrate customers leading to churn.\n",

      "\n",
      "6. **Technology Limitations**: Outdated technology can hinder operational efficiency, leading to increased errors in order fulfillment and returns processing. An investment in better systems and integration between various platforms can streamline operations entirely.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations for Action\n",

      "- If no improvements are made in the refund request process, the financial exposure will continue to rise.\n",

    "\n",
    "![Handoff Orchestration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/user-guide/workflows/resources/images/orchestration-handoff.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "In a **Handoff** orchestration, agents transfer control to one another based on context \u2014 there is **no central orchestrator**. Each agent can decide when to hand the conversation off to another specialist, creating dynamic, peer-to-peer routing. This is fundamentally different from the other orchestrations we've built so far:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Handoff | Sequential / Group Chat |\n",
    "|--------|---------|------------------------|\n",
    "| **Control Flow** | Agents pass control to each other directly | Orchestrator / fixed order manages flow |\n",
    "| **Task Ownership** | Receiving agent takes **full ownership** | Orchestrator retains responsibility |\n",
    "| **Context** | Full conversation history shared across all agents | Varies by orchestration type |\n",
    "| **Topology** | Mesh \u2014 agents form a peer network | Star / chain \u2014 central coordinator |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core API\n",
    "\n",
    "| Method | Purpose |\n",
    "|--------|---------|\n",
    "| `HandoffBuilder(name, participants)` | Create a handoff workflow with specialist agents |\n",
    "| `.with_start_agent(agent)` | Set which agent receives user input first |\n",
    "| `.add_handoff(source, [targets])` | Define custom routing rules (who can hand off to whom) |\n",
    "| `.with_termination_condition(fn)` | Custom logic to decide when the workflow completes |\n",
    "| `.with_autonomous_mode()` | Agents continue without waiting for human input |\n",
    "| `HandoffAgentUserRequest.create_response(text)` | Send user reply when an agent pauses for input |\n",
    "| `HandoffAgentUserRequest.terminate()` | End the workflow early from the user side |\n",
    "\n",
    "## InboxOps Use Case: Multi-Department Email Escalation\n",
    "\n",
    "Real support inboxes don't have a single agent that handles everything. Instead, emails flow through **multiple departments** depending on the issue:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Customer Email\n",
    "    \u2193\n",
    "\u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n",
    "\u2502  Triage     \u2502  \u2190 Reads the email, classifies the issue\n",
    "\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n",
    "       \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2192 Billing Agent      (payment disputes, invoices, subscription changes)\n",
    "       \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2192 Account Agent      (password resets, access, account closures)\n",
    "       \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2192 Compliance Agent   (data requests, GDPR, legal escalations)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each specialist has **domain-specific tools** and can **escalate to other departments** when the issue crosses boundaries \u2014 e.g. a billing dispute that reveals a security breach gets escalated from Billing \u2192 Accounts \u2192 Compliance. The triage agent never touches the issue itself; it only routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly what **handoff** is designed for \u2014 no central brain re-reads every message; agents hand off ownership entirely."

    "# 17. Workflow Checkpointing & Recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "![Checkpointing](https://learn.microsoft.com/agent-framework/user-guide/workflows/resources/images/checkpointing.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It's **Cyber Monday** at InboxOps. The team needs to process **10,000 customer emails** in a batch workflow. Each email goes through:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Classify** (spam, urgent, general)\n",
    "2. **Draft Response** (using AI)\n",
    "3. **Quality Check** (grammar, tone)\n",
    "4. **Send** (log to CRM)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem**: Processing all 10K emails takes 2 hours. If the server crashes at email 7,843, they'd have to **restart from zero** \u2014 wasting time and money.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution**: **Workflow Checkpointing** \u2014 save progress at intervals and **resume from the last checkpoint** after failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Checkpointing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Checkpointing allows workflows to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Save state** at specific points (super steps)\n",
    "- **Resume execution** after process restarts or failures\n",
    "- **Persist executor state** (e.g., processed email count, partial results)\n",
    "- **Rehydrate workflows** from checkpoints to new instances\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "\u2705 **Fault Tolerance** \u2014 Recover from server crashes, network issues  \n",
    "\u2705 **Long-Running Processes** \u2014 Process thousands of items reliably  \n",
    "\u2705 **Cost Efficiency** \u2014 Don't re-process completed work  \n",
    "\u2705 **Debugging** \u2014 Inspect workflow state at specific points  \n",
    "\u2705 **Human-in-the-Loop** \u2014 Pause for approvals, resume later\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use Checkpointing\n",
    "\n",
    "| Scenario | Why Checkpointing Helps |\n",
    "|----------|------------------------|\n",
    "| **Batch Processing** | Resume from failure in 10K email processing |\n",
    "| **Multi-Stage Pipelines** | Save progress after each stage |\n",
    "| **Approval Workflows** | Pause for human approval, resume later |\n",
    "| **Resource-Intensive Tasks** | Stop/restart workflows based on resource availability |\n",
    "| **Debugging** | Time-travel to specific workflow states |\n",
    "\n",
    "## InboxOps Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "InboxOps processes emails in batches of 100. After each batch:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Checkpoint created** automatically\n",
    "2. **Progress saved** (emails processed, drafts generated)\n",
    "3. **If server crashes**, workflow resumes from last completed batch\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result**: 10K emails processed with zero data loss, even during infrastructure failures."
